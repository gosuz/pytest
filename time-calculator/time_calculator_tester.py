'''
for a time calculator what is the unit test?
making sure each function works as intended.
    E.g. each prompt
    The total of the added numbers are correct. (e.g. the output from adding the list)

Functional testing would be something like if you have multiple functions, it should work as intended
    E.g. Between two unit tests ((1)input prompt, (2)then using the input prompt to create a list which adds everything together)

    Another example would be: if you have substraction involved. You can add times, then you can substract times. A function test will involve adding things together and then substracting it.

TLDR:
    Unit test for:
        1. Input Function (input - checking the input is valid)
        2. Time Addition (the logic)
        3. Time Substraction (the logic)
    Functional test for:
        1. Input + addtion
        2. Input + substraction
        3. Input + addition + substraction
