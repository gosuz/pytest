This is a collection of projects with a focus on practing writing pytest.

It is a work in progress. Current projects include:
- Python time calculator (only addition right now)
- Black Jack (credit goes to my friend Dan, for letting me fork his repository): https://github.com/DanielChin327/w_coding_black_jack_python
      - I've kept the black_jack file and added my own pytests
